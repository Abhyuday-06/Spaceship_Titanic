# Spaceship Titanic Competition

This project is a solution for the Spaceship Titanic competition on Kaggle. It uses a TensorFlow Decision Forests model to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension.

## Dataset

The dataset is from the Spaceship Titanic competition on Kaggle. It contains information about passengers on a spaceship, including their age, cabin, and whether they were transported.

## Model

The model is a TensorFlow Decision Forests model. It is a tree-based model that is well-suited for tabular data.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You will also need to install the following libraries:

- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Decision Forests
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Usage

To run this project, you can open the `main.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook and run all of the cells. This will train the model and generate a submission file.
